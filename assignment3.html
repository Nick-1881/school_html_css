<h3>The Golden Retriever</h3>

<blockquote>Golden Retrievers are one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States for good reason. They are intelligent, loyal, easy to train, and very affectionate.<br> They make wonderful family dogs because they are great with young children and other dogs.<br><br>

Golden Retrievers are medium-sized sporting dogs that weigh on average 55-75 pounds, with females weighing on the lower end of this range. <br>Their height can range from 21-24 inches tall. They have a broad head, short ears, deep chest, and very muscular build.</blockquote>
