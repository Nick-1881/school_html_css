 <h3>Golden Retriever puppies</h3>

 <blockquote>The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America's most popular dog breeds. They <br>are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other <br>competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work. The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium <br> size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name.</blockquote>
